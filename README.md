# Business Site


I wanted to create a business for selling plants. I thought this would be easy to obtain nice free images and should ne workable. The site should have a sign-up form, a Hero image and an accordion styled with JS.
## The problem

I approached the problem using a mobile-first methodology and flex box. The idea was for the content of the accordion and sign-up form to not vary, only their positions on the website. I used JS to make the accordion interactive AND also the form interactive as well. I custome styled the sign-up checkboxes and radio buttons. I did want to add an icon to the accordion, but I didn't have time.

## View it live
Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
